# What is Luniv-Strings?

Luniv Strings is a string manipulation library for JavaScript.

It was created primarily as a tool to help me at my day job and when completing Game Jam's using the [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) game engine.

# How to Use

For now, you can use the [minified version.](https://github.com/Sieep-Coding/luniv-strings/releases/tag/release)

# Inspiration
The inspiration is primarily from [plexis](https://github.com/plexis-js/plexis/). 

Where they are similar, I believe my code checks for edge-cases better and is written in an expressive manner using `functions`.
